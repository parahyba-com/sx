YOU MUST FOLLOW THE PROJECT'S GUIDELINES/INSTRUCTIONS.
YOU MUST CHECK IF THERE IS AN OPEN ISSUE FOR THE CHANGES YOU ARE MAKING. IF NOT, CREATE ONE FIRST.
YOU MUST CHECK IF THERE IS ALREADY AN OPEN PULL REQUEST FOR THE SAME ISSUE BEFORE CREATING A NEW ONE.
Understand the changes, commit what's necessary, and create a concise pull request description summarizing the changes made.
Remember: every pull request must have a previous issue created for it.
Remember: if you are on the `master` branch, you must create a new branch for your changes. NEVER commit directly to `master`.
