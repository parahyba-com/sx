# UI/UX Guidelines

Always take a mobile-first approach when designing user interfaces. Ensure that designs are responsive and adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes. Use consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes to create a cohesive look and feel. Prioritize accessibility by following WCAG guidelines and testing with assistive technologies.
